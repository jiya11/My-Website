      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        This project was created to explore how machine learning can help catch suspicious emails that might slip past the human eye. We were especially curious about how neural networks can learn patterns and context from large datasets, and applying that to email fraud detection.
      </p>

      <h3>Features</h3>
      <p>The tool works as a web application where users can sign in using their Gmail account. After logging in, our app uses the Gmail API to access a set number of recent emails. From there, it runs a machine learning model to analyze whether the messages seem legitimate or suspicious — with no data ever stored in a database, keeping user privacy intact. To build this, we trained a custom neural network in Google Colab using a dataset of phishing and legitimate emails from Kaggle. We cleaned and preprocessed the data, removed stop words (like “the” and “with”), and used tokenization to convert the emails into numerical representations. Our model was tailored for natural language processing and achieved around 95% accuracy on unseen data. Once the model was trained, we built the user interface using React for the frontend and Flask for the backend. Integrating the Gmail API was a challenge — especially since we initially only got snippets of emails — but we eventually got it working with full email bodies, allowing for more accurate analysis.</p>

      <h3>Tools Used</h3>
      <p>What's next:
        We'd love to expand the project to detect trends over time, like flagging repeat senders of phishing emails or identifying common wording across attacks.
        
        Built With:
        Flask • React • Python • Pytorch • Google Colab • Gmail API • Kaggle • Machine Learning</p>
